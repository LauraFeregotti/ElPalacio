Redesign of a perfumery and hairsalon website "El Palacio Sal√≥n" (Responsive website)

I found myself with a website that had poor UI and UX so I had to redesign it.
After going through the whole Design Thinking process (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test),
I came out with this responsive website made with Bootstrap.
