# ElPalacio

Redesign of a perfumery and hairsalon website "El Palacio Salón" (Responsive website)
Freelance work
Jun 2018 – Jul 2018
La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina

I found myself with a website that had poor UI and UX so I had to redesign it.
After going through the whole Design Thinking process (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test),
I came out with this responsive website made with Bootstrap.
